# Tic-Tac-Toe

A command-line implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built with TypeScript using object-oriented programming principles and design patterns.

## üéÆ Features

- Classic 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe gameplay
- Supports multiple players
- Customizable board size
- Extensible winning condition strategies
- Clean object-oriented architecture

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This implementation follows SOLID principles and incorporates several design patterns:

- **Factory Method Pattern**: Used for cell creation through `CellFactory`
- **Strategy Pattern**: Applied for winning condition checks with `WinningStrategyI` interface
- **Inheritance**: Cell hierarchy with abstract base class and concrete implementations

### Class Structure

- `Game`: Main controller that orchestrates game flow
- `Board`: Represents the game board and manages moves
- `Player`: Represents a player with name and cell type
- `Cell`: Abstract base class for different cell types (X and Y)
- `WinningStrategyI`: Strategy interface for checking win conditions

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- TypeScript
- Node.js
- Jest (for testing)

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.0.0 or higher)
- npm or yarn

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kashaf12/LLD.git
   cd Tic-Tac-Toe
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## üöÄ Running the Game

Run the game with the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Follow the prompts to play the game. Players take turns entering coordinates for their moves in the format `row col` (e.g., `1 2`).

## üß™ Running Tests

Run the test suite with:

```bash
npm test
```

## üß© Code Examples

### Initializing the Game

```typescript
import { CellType } from "./Cell";
import { CellFactory } from "./CellFactory";
import { Game } from "./Game";
import { Player } from "./Player";

// Create players with X and Y cells
const playerXCell = CellFactory.createCell(CellType.X);
const playerYCell = CellFactory.createCell(CellType.Y);
const player1 = new Player("Player 1", playerXCell);
const player2 = new Player("Player 2", playerYCell);

// Initialize game with a 3x3 board
const game = new Game([player1, player2], 3);
game.startGame();
```

### Making a Move

```typescript
// Inside Game.startGame method
const { x, y } = await Game.getMoveFromUser();
this.gameBoard.makeMove(player, x, y);
```

## üõ£Ô∏è Future Enhancements

- Add AI opponent with different difficulty levels
- Implement game history and replay functionality
- Create a graphical user interface
- Add network play support
- Implement custom player symbols beyond X and Y

## üß† Learning Value

This project demonstrates:

- Proper OOP principles
- Implementation of design patterns
- TypeScript type safety
- Test-driven development
- Clean code practices
